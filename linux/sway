Brave/Chrome does not open File Open / Save dialogs in sway (wayland)

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/blink-based-browsers-dont-open-file-dialog-in-sway-fedora-38/90403/3

had the same issue, I fixed it by adding gnome;sway to UseIn in /usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/portals/gtk.portal
without this config there is no dbus interface org.freedesktop.impl.portal.FileChooser
not sure what should be the default interface for sway or how it was working previously
log out log back in


Open Brave Browser with native Wayland drawing (nicer fonts!!)

cp /usr/share/applications/brave-browser.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/

vim ~/.local/share/applications/brave-browser.desktop


Exec=brave-browser --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland %U
