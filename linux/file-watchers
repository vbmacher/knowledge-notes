Sometimes, IntelliJ IDEA suggests to increase inotify watches:

https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Inotify+Watches+Limit


1. Add the following line to either /etc/sysctl.conf file or a new *.conf file (e.g. idea.conf) under /etc/sysctl.d/ directory:

    fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288

2. Then run this command to apply the change:

    sudo sysctl -p --system

    (or)

    sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl.service


However, setting good value might be tricky, because on 32-bit systems one watch consumes 540bytes, and on 64-bit system 1KB:

So, how to know if I'm really out of watches?

    https://askubuntu.com/questions/154255/how-can-i-tell-if-i-am-out-of-inotify-watches

    tail -f /var/log/dmesg     - if the output is "tail: cannot watch '/var/log/dmsg': No space left on device"


If I also want to know the actual current number of inotify watches:

     sudo lsof | grep -i inotify | wc -l


Get currently max value of watches (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/13751/kernel-inotify-watch-limit-reached):

     cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
