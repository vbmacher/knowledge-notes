remove the local branches that are not on the remote:
git remote prune origin

remove local branches that were created from those remote branches:
git branch -r | awk '{print $1}' | egrep -v -f /dev/fd/0 <(git branch -vv | grep origin) | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -d


delete all local branches that are already merged into master:
git branch --merged master | grep -v '^[ *]*master$' | xargs git branch -d
